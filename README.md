### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

<!-- Put your answer to question 1 here -->
One possible chatroom moderation feature is to require login. This will prevent users from participating anonymously which there is evidence that anonymity increases incivility. Another moderation feature is banning which woud allow the platform to kick users off when a particular user is posing a detriment to all. This feature could be used in cases of harassment and would be most effective if the platform could do a site-wide ban.
